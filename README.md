# Hackdustry
The world's first mindustry """cheat""" mod that unlocks locked contents and many more.

## Vanilla Compatibility
Absolutely none, this mod is meant to destroy your save files as a punishment for being lazy and not playing the game for real. Though it won't really happen since I haven't added that yet.
